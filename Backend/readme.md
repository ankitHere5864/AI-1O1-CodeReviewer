❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function getValue() => {return someValue;}
```

🔍 Issues:
*   ❌ SyntaxError: Unexpected token '=>'. This arrow function syntax is invalid in this context. It seems like the function body is missing curly braces and a `return` keyword.
*   ❌ `someValue` is not defined, leading to a `ReferenceError` if the function is executed.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function getValue() {
  return someValue;
}
```

or, if you intend to use arrow function:

```javascript
const getValue = () => {
  return someValue;
}
```

or even shorter:

```javascript
const getValue = () => someValue;
```

💡 Improvements:

*   ✔ The function is now correctly defined, resolving the SyntaxError.
*   ✔ It still needs a valid definition or initialization for `someValue` to work without a `ReferenceError`.  Consider replacing `someValue` with a specific value or a variable that's defined in the scope.

Final Note:

Make sure `someValue` is properly defined in the scope where `getValue` is being called. If `getValue` should return a fixed value, replace `someValue` with that value.  If it is supposed to retrieve a value, ensure `someValue` is declared and assigned a value before `getValue` is called. For example:

```javascript
let someValue = 42; // Define someValue

function getValue() {
  return someValue;
}

console.log(getValue()); // Output: 42
```
